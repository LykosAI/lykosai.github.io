        <p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
        <p>You hereby agree to indemnify and hold Lykos, LLC harmless from and against all liabilities, damages, losses or expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney or other professional fees in any claim, demand, action or proceeding initiated by any third-party against Lykos, LLC, arising from any of your acts, including without limitation, violating this EULA or any other agreement or any applicable law.</p>
